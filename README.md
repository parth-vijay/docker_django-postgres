# Docker Compose with Django, Postgresql and PGAdmin

For this project, you need to create a Dockerfile, a Python dependencies file, and a docker-compose.yml file. (You can use either a .yml or .yaml extension for this file.)

## Create an empty project directory:

	mkdir project_docker && cd project_docker

## Create python environment:

	virtualenv env

## Activate an environment:

For Linux/Mac - 
	
	source env/bin/activate

For Windows - 
	
	.\bin\Scripts\activate

##Clone the repository:

		git clone https://github.com/parth1625/docker_django-postgres.git

## Install *django* and *psycopg2-binary* library using pip:

	pi3 install -r requirements.txt
	pip3 install django
	pip3 install psycopg2-binary

## Freeze the *requirements.txt* file:

	pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

If you are running Docker on Linux, the files django-admin created are owned by root. This happens because the container runs as the root user. Change the ownership of the new files.

		sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .

If you are running Docker on Mac or Windows, you should already have ownership of all files, including those generated by django-admin.

## Run the **docker-compose** up command from the top level directory for your project:

		sudo docker-compose up
		sudo docker-compose up -d (To run the container in the backgorund)

## TO check the list of running container:

		sudo docker ps 

## To stop the running container:

		sudo docker-compose down

To check the Django app, go to **localhost:8000** on your browser.
And to see the PGAdmin page, go to **localhost:5050** and login using your email and password you given in *pgadmin* service in *docker-compose.yml*.
